# CTS-SAT-1-DCLB-Burnwire-PCB

Low Side Switch Circuit design that uses the resistors to do the power disipation instead of the the control IC.

Switch: BTS3405GXUMA1
Resistors: RW81U10R0FB12 - Wirewound Resistors - Through Hole 1watt 10ohms 1%

300mA at 5V should be sufficent to reach the 150C needed to melt Dyneema

This design could also be combined with other designs like the orginial circuit for further redundancy.
